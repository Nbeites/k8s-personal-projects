- After first installation, install at least "pipeline" plugin,
to create the first pipeline with .jenkinsfile

- And probably it needs also:

    -pipeline-stage-view:latest
    -workflow-aggregator:latest
    -kubernetes:latest
    -git:latest
    -docker-workflow:latest

- NOTE: In this version of jenkins (as of 10 October 2024 the latest is Jenkins v2.462.3)
 there is an option to

- In first installation search for this log for admin password

    Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.
    Please use the following password to proceed to installation:

    1b221130b6da44cbab9a28d71d335566

- This may also be found at: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    - cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

- Then redefine password for admin (user: admin , pass: admin)

- Define the default address and port to access (inside jenkins) (Eg. http://localhost:8080/)
(This will be the port inside the pod, not related to port forward)
(Should be the same as the defined in deployment.yaml to avoid confusion, but can be different)
NOTE: But the port of the deployment.yaml MUST BE 8080 (Jenkins Default)
